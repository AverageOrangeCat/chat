# Chat üéâ

## General

Chat is a simple project I wanted to create to ...

1. ... imporve my coding skills
2. ... learn how to host fully featured websites
3. ... have fun ü•≥

This isn't anything serious, just a side project of mine!

## Mockups

I created some mockups to make important design choices like coloring, layout, etc.
